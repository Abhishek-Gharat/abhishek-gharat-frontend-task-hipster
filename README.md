# Multi-Theme Switcher App

**Developer**: Abhishek Gharat  
**Position Applied**: React Frontend Developer - Hipster Inc.  
**Submission Date**: August 4, 2025

## 🎯 Project Overview

A sophisticated React-based web application featuring a dynamic theme switcher with three distinct themes. Each theme transforms not just colors, but completely alters the layout structure, typography, spacing, and user experience - exactly as specified in the Hipster Inc. technical requirements.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Three Distinct Themes
- **Theme 1 (Minimalist)**: Clean layout with light background, Inter font, and simple design
- **Theme 2 (Dark Sidebar)**: Dark mode with sidebar navigation, Playfair Display serif font, and professional layout  
- **Theme 3 (Colorful Cards)**: Vibrant theme with Pacifico font, gradient backgrounds, and playful design

### 🚀 Advanced Functionality
- **Theme Persistence**: Uses localStorage to maintain theme preference across sessions
- **Context API**: Professional state management for theme switching (no Redux to keep it lightweight)
- **Multiple API Integration**: DummyJSON (primary), Platzi API, and FakeStore API with intelligent fallback
- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant transitions during theme changes with staggered animations
- **React Router**: Multi-page navigation (Home, About, Contact, 404)
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and professional code practices
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach optimized for all devices
- **Security**: XSS protection, input sanitization, and type-safe implementations

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (as requested - no Material UI or Ant Design)
- **UI Components**: Custom components with shadcn/ui utilities
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **State Management**: Context API
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API with custom hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: npm

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-Gharat/abhishek-gharat-frontend-task-hipster.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd multi-theme-switcher-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Environment Setup
No environment variables required - the app works out of the box with public APIs.

## 🎨 Theme Implementation Details

### Theme 1 - Minimalist (Default)
- **Layout**: Fixed header + main content
- **Colors**: Light grays, whites, subtle shadows
- **Typography**: Inter font family (clean sans-serif)
- **Components**: Minimal borders, clean cards, subtle hover effects

### Theme 2 - Dark Sidebar
- **Layout**: Collapsible sidebar + main content area
- **Colors**: Dark backgrounds (#1E1E2E) with blue/purple accents
- **Typography**: Playfair Display serif font (bold, elegant)
- **Components**: Enhanced shadows, sidebar navigation, premium feel

### Theme 3 - Colorful Cards
- **Layout**: Fixed header with gradient backgrounds
- **Colors**: Purple, pink, orange gradients throughout
- **Typography**: Pacifico playful font (fun, creative)
- **Components**: Gradient borders, colorful animations, card-based design

## 🔌 API Integration

### Primary API - DummyJSON (Recommended)
```typescript
// High-quality product data with images
https://dummyjson.com/products?limit=50
```
- **Features**: Professional product images, detailed information, discount data
- **Benefits**: No rate limits, comprehensive product details, reliable uptime

### Backup APIs
```typescript
// Alternative sources for reliability
Platzi API: https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products
FakeStore API: https://fakestoreapi.com/products
```

### Smart Data Normalization
Custom `normalizeProduct` function ensures consistent data structure across all API sources, handling different response formats seamlessly.

## 📱 Responsive Design Features

- **Mobile-first approach** with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Theme-specific responsive behavior** (sidebar collapses, layouts adapt)
- **Touch-optimized interactions** for mobile devices
- **Flexible grid layouts** that adapt to screen sizes
- **Optimized image loading** with lazy loading

## 🔧 Key Technical Implementations

### Advanced Theme Context
```typescript
// Professional theme management with persistence
export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }: ThemeProviderProps) => {
  // localStorage integration for persistence
  // Smooth transition animations
  // Type-safe theme switching
};
```

### Custom API Hooks
```typescript
// Intelligent API handling with fallbacks
export const useProducts = () => {
  // Primary: DummyJSON for best quality
  // Fallback: Platzi and FakeStore APIs
  // Error handling and loading states
};
```

### Dynamic Theme Classes
```typescript
// Theme-specific styling with Tailwind
const getThemeClasses = (theme: ThemeType) => {
  // Theme 1: Minimalist classes
  // Theme 2: Dark mode classes  
  // Theme 3: Colorful gradient classes
};
```
